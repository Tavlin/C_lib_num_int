# C libary for Numerical Integration

Just a little project from university. Will get updated in the next few days(12th Dec, 2017).

## how to use(for linux and maybe mac #sry winusers :c):

1.Download the .c and .h files and the makefile into one folder
2. cd to that folder and use the command "make"
3. Now you should have a working program in that folder called prog and you can start it with '''./prog'''
